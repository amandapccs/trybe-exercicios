    <i>I guess I knew this would happen to you<br>
Inside I did, but I refuse to know the truth<br>
I'm heading back inside to sit at home with you<br>
I think I know what's wrong<br>
My friends put on their bravest face<br>
Their tales between their legs, something's out of place<br>
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face<br>
Keep your mouth zipped, son<br>
Baby, I've been there before<br>
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone<br>
And now I'm still hanging on<br>
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was<br>
Tell me all important stuff<br>
What's your favorite colour?<br>
What makes you so tough?<br>
Please don't let go when you've had enough<br>
I'm on my knees<br>
Baby, I've been there before<br>
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone<br>
And now I'm still hanging on<br>
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was<br>
Baby, I've been there before<br>
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone<br>
And now I'm still hanging on<br>
I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was<br>
Waiting for my love<br>
Waiting for-</i><br></p>
